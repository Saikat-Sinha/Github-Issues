# `Github Issues Clone` â€” with AngularJS 1.5

This project is an GitHub Issues AngularJS web application.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository.
You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.

### Clone `GitHub Issues`

Clone the repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Saikat-Sinha/Github-Issues.git
```


### Install Dependencies

I have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

-Dependencies are:
    *Angular 1.5.x
    *Angular-Route 1.5.x
    *Moment.js
    *Angular-Moment



I have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so you can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files


### Run the Application

 The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000`].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  views/
      issuesView/                --> the view template and logic for individual issues
        view1.html            --> the partial template
        main.js              --> the controller logic

      mainView/                --> the view template and logic for main page
        main.html            --> the partial template
        main.js              --> the controller logic

  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
```

## Bug with the Application

After adding a new Issue if you click on any issue and then come back to home page, the added issue does not appear.

## Features for Future

1. A search option AJAX enabled : could not enable due to GitHub's API exploitation rule which would result in 403 error.

2. Comment on each Issue post to be loaded: could not load due to GitHub's API exploitation rule which would result in 403 error.
